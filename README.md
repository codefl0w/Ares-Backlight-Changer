Change backlight colors for Redmi K40 Gaming [ARES/ARESIN]


A very simple app to change the backlight color on the Redmi K40 Gaming device. (in theory, it should also work on K50 Gaming)

THIS APP REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS.

Well... I made this app two years ago and couldn't even push the source from github.com with drag-and-drop, so instead of using Git like a normal person, I decided to upload the source later.

The said source is now gone forever.  All the app does anyways is run something like `echo 255 > /sys/class/led/red` to make the LED glow red at the highest brightness and so on. You can't recreate the animations without the app though.
If anyone is still somehow viewing this thread and also using the device, you can create an issue. If there's even the slightest demand, I'll remake the app. I have parts of the code here and there and it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to remake it.
